Description: tools and components for VMware guest systems
 The Open Virtual Machine Tools (open-vm-tools) are the open source
 implementation of VMware Tools. They are a set of guest operating system
 virtualization components that enhance performance and user experience of
 virtual machines.

 As virtualization technology rapidly becomes mainstream, each virtualization
 solution provider implements their own set of tools and utilities to supplement
 the guest virtual machine. However, most of the implementations are proprietary
 and are tied to a specific virtualization platform.
