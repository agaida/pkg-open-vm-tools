open-vm-tools 2008.06.18 changes:
	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1847750 (FreeBSD 7 & 8 builds) and Sourceforge
	bug 1981632 (build failure on Solaris). This should get open-vm-tools
	building and running on FreeBSD 7 & 8 and Solaris. Thanks to Martin
	Blapp for all the FreeBSD patches, and Jonathan Keatley for reporting
	the Solaris bug.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1968416 (packet counting in FreeBSD vmxnet).
	Thanks to Shunsuke SHINOMIYA for reporting this bug.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1983375 (Cannot specify kernel constraints).
	You can now pass --without-kernel-modules, --with-kernel-release, and
	--with-linuxdir to the ./configure script. Thanks to Craig Phillips for
	reporting this bug.

	* Other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.06.03 changes:
	* Added the vmware-user-suid-wrapper application, with implementations
	for Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. This app is needed to make correct use
	of vmware-user with the vmblock kernel module. It should have been in
	the previous code refresh, but we accidentally overlooked it.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1924246: vmhgfs on Linux properly reports the
	available space on the host. Thanks to Mikhail Krivtsov for reporting
	the bug.

	* Fixed Sourceforge bug 1839981: we now have rudimentary `make install`
	support. On any platform, it should copy files and kernel modules to
	the location specified at build-time, and on Linux, it will additionally
	run `depmod -a` to make the kernel modules accessible to modprobe. This
	change also adds a "--with-pam-prefix" argument to the configure
	script, which controls the location of guestd's pam files.
	
	* Other bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.05.15 changes:
	* guestd no longer starts vmware-user. Packagers will need to use
	the XDG autostart spec, Xsession drop-in scripts, or other appropriate
	mechanisms to make sure that vmware-user is started as part of
	X session initialization. Please see
	http://open-vm-tools.wiki.sourceforge.net/Packaging for more details.

	* Bug fixes as usual.

open-vm-tools 2008.05.02 changes:
	* Continued Unicode support.

	* open-vm-tools now depends on libicu for codeset conversions. If you
	wish to build open-vm-tools without libicu, pass "--without--icu" when
	configuring the package. Without libicu, codeset conversions will be
	done as before, via calls to iconv.
	
	* A few more bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.04.14 changes:
	* Update the license stamp on all LGPL files.

	* Continued Unicode support.

	* Handle libdumbnet on Debian.

	* More bug fixes, including a security fix in guestd.

open-vm-tools 2008.03.19 changes:
	* Continued Unicode support.

	* A few bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.03.03 changes:
	* Bug fixes (including the ability to specify custom LDFLAGS
	at build time, thanks to Mike Auty).

	* First cut of HGFSv3 implementation.

	* Beginnings of DnDv3 implementation.

	* Add Unicode support all over the code base.

open-vm-tools 2008.02.13 changes:
	* Some bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2008.01.23 changes:

	* The Linux HGFS kernel module now supports writeback caching, which
	should yield better performance.

	* Added a generic Unicode-aware library to ease i18n and l10n work.

	* A bunch of bug fixes.

open-vm-tools 2007.11.15 "Bandsaw" changes:

	* Kernel modules for FreeBSD, including an experimental port of HGFS to
	FreeBSD.

	* Add the vmsync driver on Linux to make VM snapshots consistent.

	* Added the xferlogs utility, the *-vm-default scripts, and the
	vm-support script.

	* Build on a wider variety of systems.

	* Lots of smaller bug fixes throughout the code.

open-vm-tools 2007.09.04 "Axe" changes:
	* Initial release of open-vm-tools.
