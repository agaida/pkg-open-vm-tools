open-vm-tools 2008.05.15 changes:
	* guestd no longer starts vmware-user. Packagers will need to use
	the XDG autostart spec, Xsession drop-in scripts, or other appropriate
	mechanisms to make sure that vmware-user is started as part of
	X session initialization. Please see
	http://open-vm-tools.wiki.sourceforge.net/Packaging for more details.

	* Bug fixes as usual.

open-vm-tools 2008.05.02 changes:
	* Continued Unicode support.

	* open-vm-tools now depends on libicu for codeset conversions. If you
	wish to build open-vm-tools without libicu, pass "--without--icu" when
	configuring the package. Without libicu, codeset conversions will be
	done as before, via calls to iconv.
	
	* A few more bug fixes.
